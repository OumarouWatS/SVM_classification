# SVM_classification
The goal of this project was to classify penguins in 3 classes: "adelie", "gentoo", and "chinstrap". Training data was pulled from Kaggle into a Python Jupiter Notebook. Data was explored, cleaned and made training ready. Then, research was conducted to identify best fitting machine learning model. A support vector machine model was selected and trained to conduct the classification. 

Pendas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn Python library were used here!

Below, is the outline of steps taken to achieve penguins classification in the project:
  1. Set up and imports
  2. Loading Penguins Data
  3. Data exploration and cleaning
  4. Built a preprocessing data pipeline using a SimpleImputer and StandardScaler
  5. Conducted a linear grid search
  6. SVM model fitting/training
  7. Model performance evaluation with confusion matrix
  8. Grid search and fitting on a Polynomial Kernel
  9. Grid search and fitting on a Gaussian Kernel
  10. Plotting to visualize models performances
